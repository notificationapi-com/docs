Web push notifications look almost identical to native notification on the device. However, they require the user to opt-in from their browser when they are on your website/front-end.

Not to be confused with [Mobile Push](./mobile-push) notifications that are truly native (delivered from installed apps), or [In-App Notifications](./inapp) that are displayed inside your UI, e.g. inside a bell icon or webpage.

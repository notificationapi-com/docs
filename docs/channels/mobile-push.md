# ðŸ“± Mobile Push

## Overview

Mobile Push is a channel that allows you to send push notifications to your users' mobile devices. You can send push notifications to iOS and Android devices.

## Requirements

- Setting up [Apple Push Notification Service] or Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) ðŸ‘‰ [step-by-step guide](../guides/mobile-push)
- Integrating our easy-to-use [iOS SDK](../reference/ios-sdk) or [Android SDK](../reference/android_sdk) into your apps

:::note
Mobile push notification is the only channel in NotificationAPI that relies on external 3rd-parties (Apple and FCM). This is due to a limitation of the mobile operating systems.

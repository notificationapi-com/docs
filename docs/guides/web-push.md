# üåê Setup Web Push

NotificationAPI supports sending web push notifications. While most notification channels like email or call only require using our [back-end SDK](../quick-start/send-a-notification), web push notification requires our front-end SDK and service worker to display them.

## Configuring Web Push Notifications

Web push notifications are integrated with the front-end JS SDK. Please follow the setup instructions [here](../reference/js-client#setup).

   :::warning
   The [Service Worker](../reference/js-client.md#service-worker-setup) is required to receive web push notifications.

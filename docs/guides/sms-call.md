# SMS/Call Notifications

## Origin Phone Number

SMS and phone call notifications from **free accounts** originate from a shared phone number: +16505501770. We do not guarantee that the free account phone number stays the same.

Each **Paid account** has a dedicated phone number from the +1 (650) area code.

## Phone Number Format

You should format the phone numbers with a + and country code, for example, +16175551212 (E.164 standard). We accept unformatted US/Canada numbers, e.g., (415) 555-1212, 415-555-1212, or 4155551212.

## Maximum Length

SMS messages and phone call scripts have a maximum length of 800 characters, including the actual merge tag values.

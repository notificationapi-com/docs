# âœ‹ Notification Throttling

Throttiling allows you to prevent software bugs or UX flaws from flooding your end-users with too many notifications.

## How does it work?

You can pick how many of the same notification you want to allow to be sent to a user within a given time window.

For example, if you configure throttling to allow 5 `delivery_tracking` notifications within one hour, it means that:

- You can still send 10 `delivery_tracking` notifications to 10 different users within one hour
- The same user can only receive 5 within one hour
- The 6th `delivery_tracking` notification to the same user within one hour will be ignored
- Ignored requests are properly logged in our logs and insights features

## How to use the throttling feature?

Throttling can be configured on a per-notification basis in the notification configuration page.

It is disabled by default.

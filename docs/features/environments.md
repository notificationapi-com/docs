# âš™ Testing Environments

You can create a new independent testing environment to test your notifications with.

## Creating a Testing Environment

To create a testing environment, navigate to the "API Keys" page. Then click on the "Add Testing Environment" button. This will create a new set of API keys that target a testing environment.

## Preventing Notification Deliveries

Using a testing environment you can send notifications and prevent deliveries. Notifications are still processed and can be inspected via the "Logs" page. Disabling deliveries allows you to test and inspect notifications without actually sending them to end-users.

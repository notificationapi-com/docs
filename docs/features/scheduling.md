# ‚è∞ Scheduling

:::note

Status: This feature is under active development.

:::

Scheduling a notification works just like sending a regular notification through NotificationAPI, with the addition of a `schedule` field that specifies when you want the notification sent. Our system takes care of the rest. Our dashboard will keep track of scheduled notifications in the logs section, marking them as scheduled and showing the time they are scheduled to be sent. You can also update or delete a scheduled notification by using the trackingId.

## Example Use Cases

- Payment due alerts: Financial institutions and billing departments use scheduled notifications to remind customers of upcoming due dates for loan payments, credit card bills, or utility bills.

- Appointment reminders: Healthcare providers, beauty salons, automotive service centers, and other appointment-based businesses utilize scheduled notifications to remind clients of their upcoming appointments.

- Task deadlines: Project management tools often feature the ability to send scheduled notifications about task deadlines to team members.

## How does it work?

Simply specify the `schedule` parameter when using the [`send` function](../reference/server#send):

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Can I update a notification request after scheduling it?

Yes, you can update the request after sending it by using the `trackingId` before it is sent. If you do not have the `trackingId`, you can still find it in the [log dashboard](logs.md).

### Can I cancel a scheduled notification?

Yes, with the `trackingId`, you can cancel a scheduled notification before it is sent. If the notification has already been sent, you can retract in-app notifications using the [retract function](../reference/server.md#retract).

### How are errors handled in scheduled notifications?

We check your request at two stages. First, when you submit a request to schedule a notification, we verify the format and accuracy of the request, including the correctness of the `notificationId`. The results of this step can be found in the response body of your request and in our [log dashboard](logs.md). Secondly, we check the request at the scheduled time for logic and usage limits. The outcomes of this step are also available on our [log dashboard](logs.md).

### How are logics managed for scheduled notifications?

We evaluate logics, such as [Deduplication](deduplication.md), and [throttling](throttling.md) at the scheduled time, not when the request is initially made.

### How can I review scheduled notifications before they are sent?

Currently, our [log dashboard](logs.md) does not support this feature, but we are considering adding it in the near future.

### How far in advance can I schedule a notification?

You can schedule a notification up to 1 year in advance.

### How early in the future can I schedule a notification?

If the schedule is set for a past time, we send the notification immediately.
